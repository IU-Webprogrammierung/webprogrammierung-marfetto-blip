Portfolio Project – Web-Programming (DLBUXPWP01)

This repository contains a personal portfolio project, which was developed for the IU International University course "Web-Programmierung (DLBUXPWP01)". The objective of the project was to create a fully responsive, accessible, and visually engaging portfolio website that highlights both personal and professional aspects, with a particular emphasis on practical UX design work.



Project Idea

The main concept was to build a static website that introduces myself, my experiences and selected design projects in a professional and appealing way. The focus was on clear information architecture, aesthetic design, and precise technical implementation – relying exclusively on HTML, CSS and maybe JavaScript
